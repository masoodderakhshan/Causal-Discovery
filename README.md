## 📌 Abstract

Soil subsidence is a complex geophysical process driven by interactions between subsurface properties and atmospheric dynamics. However, traditional linear correlation analyses often fail to capture the time-lagged and non-linear mechanisms governing these interactions. This study applies the PCMCI (Partial Correlation based on Conditional Independence) causal discovery framework to disentangle the hydro-meteorological drivers of soil subsidence, specifically examining the mediating role of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC).
