## 📌 Abstract

Soil subsidence is a complex geophysical process driven by interactions between subsurface properties and atmospheric dynamics. However, traditional linear correlation analyses often fail to capture the time-lagged and non-linear mechanisms governing these interactions. This study applies the PCMCI (Partial Correlation based on Conditional Independence) causal discovery framework to disentangle the hydro-meteorological drivers of soil subsidence, specifically examining the mediating role of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). Using a split-sample approach based on a median SOC threshold, we analyzed the causal structure of subsidence dynamics at a one-month lag (τ=1). Initial correlation analysis revealed a system dominated by high inertia, where immediate environmental variables showed negligible linear association with subsidence. However, causal inference exposed a distinct bifurcation in system behavior. In low SOC regimes, the soil structure is highly reactive to atmospheric forcing; significant causal links were identified from evaporation, soil temperature, and air temperature directly to subsidence, indicating that thermal and evaporative stresses accelerate deformation. Conversely, high SOC regimes exhibited a "decoupled" behavior where subsidence was insulated from immediate meteorological anomalies, driven solely by strong auto-regressive persistence. These findings suggest that high organic carbon content acts as a critical hydraulic and structural buffer, stabilizing land surfaces against short-term climate variability. This study underscores the necessity of non-linear causal frameworks in geoscientific modeling and highlights the role of soil organic matter in mitigating climate-induced land deformation.
